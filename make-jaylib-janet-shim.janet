# create jaylib.janet, a janet file to enable `use` and `import`
# forms for jaylib to work, hopefully reducing the number of
# changes necessary to get one's jaylib-using code to work on the web

# this code "scrapes" .h files from jaylib and then creates a file
# named `jaylib.janet`.  by placing this file in an appropriate
# location (e.g. resources/jaylib.janet) for bundling by
# emcc, use of `(import jaylib)` or `(use jaylib)` or similar in one's
# janet code should (continue to) work in the context of wasm /
# emscripten.  note that use of this method is likely to add a bit of
# overhead to startup -- but perhaps it is negligible.

# sample invocation:
#
#   janet make-jaylib-janet-shim.janet jaylib/src resources/jaylib.janet
#
# `jaylib/src` is an example of where jaylib's .h files live
# `resources/jaylib.janet` is an example output file destination
